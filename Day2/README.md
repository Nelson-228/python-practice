# Day 2 â€“ Python: Loops & Caesar Cipher

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered
- Variable types with `type()`
- String indexing with `.find()`
- Case handling with `.lower()`
- Caesar cipher prep logic

## âœ… Code Summary
The code demonstrates how to:
- Get the type of a variable
- Use `.find()` to locate character positions
- Convert uppercase to lowercase
- Extract and shift characters in a cipher context

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection
I understood how to manipulate strings in preparation for Caesar cipher encryption. I handled case-sensitivity and practiced string indexing confidently.
