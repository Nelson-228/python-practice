# python-practice

These scripts are from my Phase 0 learning roadmap â€” part of my preparation for a Google internship and transfer to UCLA CS in 2026.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Scripts
- `countdown_timer.py`: A simple countdown script that prints numbers from 10 to 0 and ends with "Blast off!"
- `daily_summary.py`: A journaling CLI that summarizes your day through questions
- `filter_numbers.py`: Filters a list of numbers to return only odd values
- `password_checker.py`: A loop-based password prompt with simple logic

More projects coming as I continue sharpening my Python, algorithms, and full-stack skills.
